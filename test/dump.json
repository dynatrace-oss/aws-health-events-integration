This will migrate the instance to a new host and the instance will not be stopped. Please note that any data on local instance-store volumes will not be preserved when you stop and start your instance. For more information about stopping and starting your instance, and what to expect when your instance is stopped, such as the effect on public, private and Elastic IP addresses associated with your instance, see Stop and Start Your Instance in the EC2 User Guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html. \\n\\n* Why does my instance require maintenance?\\n\\nEC2 routinely performs maintenance on the underlying systems in order to strengthen the security, reliability and operational performance of the EC2 service for our customers. Additional information about maintenance events can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html#schedevents_actions_retire.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns, you can contact the AWS Support Team on the community forums and via AWS Premium Support at: https://aws.amazon.com/support ."

During this verification step your instance reported healthy and recovery was therefore not initiated.\\n\\nCommon reasons for this include:\\n1.

A user performed a manual override of the CloudWatch alarm by setting the alarm state to ALARM\\n\\n* What do you need to do?\\n\\nYour instance is running and reporting healthy.
